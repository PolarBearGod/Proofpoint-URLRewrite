# Proofpoint URL Rewrite in JS

Quick and dirty HTML page which rewrites Proofpoint encoded URL's using JavaScript. 

It's an easy lift and shift if you want to use it in an ITSM tool or elsewhere!

Essentially a refactor of their Python script found here: https://help.proofpoint.com/Threat_Insight_Dashboard/Concepts/How_do_I_decode_a_rewritten_URL%3F

Didn't test with v1 encoded URLs, so probably doesn't work. v2 is looking good though.

It might be useful to someone else!
