# Proofpoint URL Rewrite in JS

Quick and dirty HTML page which rewrites Proofpoint encoded URL's using JavaScript.

Essentially a refactor of their Python script found here: https://help.proofpoint.com/Threat_Insight_Dashboard/Concepts/How_do_I_decode_a_rewritten_URL%3F

Didn't test with v1 encoded URLs, so probably doesn't work. v2 is looking good though.

It might be useful to someone else!
