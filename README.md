# Proofpoint URL Rewrite in JavaScript

Quick and dirty HTML page which rewrites Proofpoint encoded URL's using JavaScript. 

It's an easy lift and shift if you want to use it in an ITSM tool or elsewhere!

Essentially a refactor of their Python script found here: https://help.proofpoint.com/Threat_Insight_Dashboard/Concepts/How_do_I_decode_a_rewritten_URL%3F

Tested with v1 and v2 URL's, both appear to decode correctly. Please open an issue if it doesn't.

It might be useful to someone else!
